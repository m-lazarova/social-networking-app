# Overview

This is a WIP social media-like app, created using Node.js, React, TypeScript and MongoDB.

## Project structure:
- the `server` directory contains the Node.js setup, running on port 8080 currently
- the `client` directory contains the React frontend setup, running on port 3000 currently

## To run locally:
- create a `.env` file with a connection to your MongoDB cluster
- run `npm install` in both server and client directories to make sure all dependencies are installed
- start the server using `npm start`
- start the clinet, using `npm start`



### Why this project?
This was a great learning opportunity for me to setup a whole project from the ground-up and learn more about MongoDB and mongoose.
